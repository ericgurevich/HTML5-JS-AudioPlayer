                    <td>
                        <h3>Functional Requirements:</h3>

                        <p>
                            When you use the "load()" function with given parameters, an 
                            audio player will be generated in your HTML page. This player
                            supports any audio file format. You can provide album art, artist
                            and track name. The player can play the song, pause, seek using
                            a playhead, and will show the current and total time. 
                        </p>
                    </td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>
                            1. Load HTML and CSS of audio player into "content" div
                            using a getElementbyID(content).innerHTML = ... . The 
                            HTML consists of the main player, a title section, 
                            a time section, an album art image, a timeline, an indicator, 
                            a play button, and a place for the track name and artist name.
                        </p>
                    </td>

                    <td>
                        <div class="jsfiddle">
                            <script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ericgurevich/a3vgy9sr/14/embed/js,html,css,result/dark/"></script>
                        </div>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>
                            2. Set global vars myaudio, playhead, and duration. Myaudio
                            refers to the the HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; element. Notice that
                            in the htmlcontent var, the &lt;audio&gt; element does not 
                            have the controls attribute, which means the browser's 
                            built in audio player is hidden. The myaudio.src attribute
                            is set to the audio file url. The current time is set to 0, 
                            album art is set, track name/artist are set, and button
                            is set to play. Then we call onLoaded() which does...
                        </p>
                    </td>

                    <td>
                        <div class="jsfiddle">
                            <script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ericgurevich/2qdzntpx/6/embed/js,html,css,result/dark/"></script>
                        </div>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>
                            3. In onLoaded(), several event listeners are added to the audio element.
                            These include duration listeners, time update, playhead drag, and song ends.
                            The timeupdate function moves the playhead using the margin-
                            left css attribute as the time of the song changes. The drag 
                            event listener relies on the draggable HTML5 attribute, which lets you
                            drag the playhead. However, this is kind of ugly because it is not
                            locked to the x axis and creates a "ghosting" effect. This can be 
                            fixed with more complicated JS or Jquery but was chosen to be simple
                            for simple JS demonstration. <br> The playPause() function is called 
                            by an onClick for the play button. 

                        </p>
                    </td>

                    <td>
                        <div class="jsfiddle">
                            <script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ericgurevich/uzcakn0g/1/embed/js,html,css,result/dark/"></script>
                        </div>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>
                            4. These last three functions are used by other functions for some
                            JS and HTML utility. The convertTime() function converts time
                            from a float to a string in HH:MM:SS format. The offset() function
                            finds the position of the playhead relative to the window (in case
                            your window is resized). The seekTime() function recieves an event
                            (in this case the time being updated by the user through a click
                            on the timeline) and manually moves the 
                            playhead to the appropriate position by getting the mouse position,
                            dividing by the timeline width, and multiplying by the total
                            length of the song. <br><br> And that's it!
                            <br> *note* The JSFiddle version does not actually play music 
                            so use the <a target="_blank" href="download/demo.html">
                                demo</a> link to see the player in action *note*
